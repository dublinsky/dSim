# dSim 

## Introduction
This is a high performance physics simulation program for drones, wrote in objective-cpp, base on mavlink OpenGL and PhysX.

## Hardware in Loop

Support Hardware in Loop for simulate for pixhawk,still have problem on position control,attitude control is OK

## Dynamics Support

You can write equations in mathematica and export them to c headers,easy use in this program, I finish the helicopter control simulation base on this.

## GUI
The GUI now is wrote in OpenGL, I have a branch wrote in Unreal communicate with this program by Mavlink is under developing, hoping one's who know well about game program for helping.

##Computer Vision

The next step I will do is export screen capture realtime to OpenCV for realtime computer vision, it will be finish in the middle May after my General Relativity test.
